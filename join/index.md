## Graduate students

I am currently reviewing applications for MS or PhD students to join the lab in Fall 2024. Students could work on a variety of projects, details to come.

In addition to funding I might have, I encourage my own students and applicants to apply for various grants and fellowships:

- [NSF GRFP](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) - Award is for three years of funding - lots of restrictions on who can apply - due in October each year
